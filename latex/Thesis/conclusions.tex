\section{Conclusion and Future works}
In this thesis, we propose a few attacks on round-reduced \KECCAK{}.
More specifically, we have proposed a preimage attack on the $2$ rounds of round-reduced $\Keccak[r:=800-384,\,c:=384]$ and successfully implemented it and found a preimage. The attack is better than the existing best-known attack in terms of the time complexity. The basic idea of the attack can also be used to mount a practical preimage attack on $\Keccak[r:=400-192,\, c:=192]$ also.
 
We also share our insights for preimage attacks on $3$ rounds of \Keccak{}-$256$ and $4$ rounds of \Keccak-$224$, although there is no improvement observed in these attacks compared to the methods described in~\cite{guo2016linear} but these methods provide different structure to attack the system with the same complexity.
From the above attacks, we conclude that these attacks are far from affecting the security strength of $24$ rounds of \Keccak{}.

Further, in the future, we will try to explore a practical attack for $2$ or more rounds of round-reduced \KECCAK-$384$, \KECCAK-$512$.
