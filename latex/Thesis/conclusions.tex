\section{Conclusion and Future works}
In this thesis, we propose a few attacks on round-reduced \KECCAK{} to cryptanalyze it. We propose a preimage attack on the $2$ rounds of round-reduced $\Keccak[r:=800-384,\,c:=384]$. This attack is practical and is also better than the existing best-known attack in terms of the time complexity. The basic idea of the attack can also be used to mount a practical preimage attack on $\Keccak[r:=400-192,\, c:=192]$ also.
 
We also propose attacks for $3$ rounds of \Keccak{}-$256$ and $4$ rounds of \Keccak-$224$, there is no improvement observed in these attacks compared to the methods described in~\cite{guo2016linear} but these methods provide different structure to attack the system with the same complexity.
From the above attacks, we conclude that these attacks are far from affecting the security strength of $24$ rounds of \Keccak{}.

Further, in the future, we will try to explore a practical attack for $2$ or more rounds of round-reduced \KECCAK-$384$, \KECCAK-$512$.
