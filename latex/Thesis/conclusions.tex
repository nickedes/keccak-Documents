\section{Conclusion and Future works}
This thesis proposes a preimage attack on the $2$ rounds of round-reduced \KECCAK-$384$. The attack is not yet practical but it is much better than the existing best-known attack in term of the time complexity. The basic idea of the attack can be used to mount a practical preimage attack on the $\Keccak[r:=400-192,\, c:=192]$ and $\Keccak[r:=800-384,\,c:=384]$. 
We have used a similar idea to mount a preimage attack on $3$ rounds of round-reduced \KECCAK-$256$, this attack though not practical is still better than the attack mentioned in~\cite{guo2016linear}.
Further, in future, we will try to explore a practical attack for the $2$ or more rounds of round-reduced \KECCAK-$384$, \KECCAK-$512$.
